Description: This package facilitates application of ontology alignment in
    Network-Extracted Ontology (NeXO) algorithm in R. This algorithm was
    originally implemented in C++ by Michael Kramer for NeXO algorithm found by
    Janusz Dutkowski. The inputs are computed and reference ontologies as
    source-target-relation data frames.
